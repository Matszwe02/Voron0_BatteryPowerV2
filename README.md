Make your voron even more reliable and more portable


This mod allows you to run your voron up to 1h with batteries. It's also a great UPS for it.


The original PSU stays inside, so you can plug in to C14 socket

## Features

- original PSU for on-grid powering
- 6x 21700 battery
- CC/CV charging the battery with PSU
- button to power on and power off (gracefully) with power indicator


## Print settings

- Voron recommended settings, so 4 walls, print with ABS
- Apply ABS shrinkage, the part is going through the whole printer width so 1mm off will make it not fit

Circuit for switching on and off battery and disconnecting galvanically PSU when powered down
- see `Schematic.pdf`
